# Mee6 (premium level-role) bypasser

This Discord Bot bypasses a premium feature of the Bot Mee6, that you can use it for free.

You can select roles, that are given to users that reach a certain Mee6-Level.

* In order to add roles, you can send a message `mb!add <Level number> <Role ID>`
* In order to remove roles, you can send a message `mb!remove <Level number>`
* In order to show all assigned roles, you can send a message `mb!show`
* In order to get the id of a role, you can send a message `mb!id <Role name>`
* Users get the roles when executing `!rank`

Note that this does only work if the leaderboard is public.
