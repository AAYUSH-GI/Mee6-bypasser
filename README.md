# Mee6 (premium level-role) bypasser

This Discord Bot bypasses a premium feature of the Bot Mee6, that you can use it for free.

You can select roles, that are given to users that reach a certain Mee6-Level.

* In order to add roles, you can send a message `mb!add <Level number> <Role ID>`
* In order to remove roles, you can send a message `mb!remove <Level number>`
* In order to show all assigned roles, you can send a message `mb!show`
* In order to get the id of a role, you can send a message `mb!id <Role name>`
* Users get the roles when executing `!rank`

Do not include greater than/lower than signs (`<>`) in the commands.

Note that this does only work if the leaderboard is public and is limited to 1000 members per server.

Other bots offer that feature with their own leveling system for free, you can try those too.
